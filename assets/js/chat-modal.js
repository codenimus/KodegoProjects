    {"message":"what is reformed theology?", "response":"Broadly speaking, Reformed theology includes any system of belief that traces its roots back to the Protestant Reformation of the 16th Century. Of course, the Reformers themselves traced their doctrine to Scripture, as indicated by their credo of 'sola scriptura,' so Reformed theology is not a 'new' belief system but one that seeks to continue apostolic doctrine."},
    {"message":"what's reformed theology?", "response":"Generally, Reformed theology holds to the authority of Scripture, the sovereignty of God, salvation by grace through Christ, and the necessity of evangelism. It is sometimes called Covenant theology because of its emphases on the covenant God made with Adam and the new covenant which came through Jesus Christ (Luke 22:20)."},

    {"message":"what is systematic theology?", "response":"'Systematic' refers to something being put into a system. Systematic theology is, therefore, the division of theology into systems that explain its various areas. For example, many books of the Bible give information about the angels. No one book gives all the information about the angels. Systematic theology takes all the information about angels from all the books of the Bible and organizes it into a system called angelology. That is what systematic theology is all about‚Äîorganizing the teachings of the Bible into categorical systems.

    {"message":"what is love?", "response":"A healthy definition of love is crucial to understanding the central message of the Bible. According to the Bible, love is not confined to sexuality, and it isn't primarily a feeling either. The Bible teaches that love is a commitment. As a commitment, love is not dependent on good feelings but rather on a consistent and corageous decision to extend oneself for the well-being of another. That commitment then produces good feelings, not the other way around. Jesus became the perfect demonstration of God's unconditional love for His people by laying down His life for the benefit of the 'elect.'"},

    {"message":"how can i be saved","response":"This simple, yet profound, question is the most important question that can be asked. <em>'How can I be saved?'</em> deals with where we will spend eternity after our lives in this world are over. There is no more important issue than our eternal destiny. Thankfully, the Bible is abundantly clear on how a person can be saved. The Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas, ‚ÄúSirs, what must I do to be saved?‚Äù (Acts 16:30). Paul and Silas responded, ‚ÄúBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved‚Äù (Acts 16:31)."},
